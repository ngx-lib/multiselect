# Multiselect

This project basically gonna help using dropdown / select in efficient manner. This idea has been inspired by AngularJS [isteven-multiselect](http://isteven.github.io/angular-multi-select). In terms of UI it will look somewhat similar to isteven multiselect, but interms of code it may not exactly architectured in the same way.
Currently I'm planning to support the feature provided by isteven-multiselect, plus other features (list going to updated soon). Still this library is under alpha version.

Before start everything make sure you've latest version of angular-cli, if not then run below command
```

To play around with this repository you have to run below two commands
1. `npm run multiselect-watch` - This command will help to build multiselect library everytime when you change any file from it.  
2. `npm start` - To run application, it will consume live multiselect library
